* Use 2 spaces for indentation. 
* Images must be .jpg/.png (preferably the latter for best quality) max filesize 500kb. 
* For small images and icons, please put them in ``img-spritesheet.png``.

* Check reddit's [css filter](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/cssfilter.py#L73) for proporties that you can use. There are a few limitations.
